### Add proper R-version folder with installed packages to libPaths
```{r}

.libPaths('/data/gpfs/projects/punim2121/R_libs/4.2.1')
.libPaths()
```

```{r}
library(zellkonverter)
library(scDblFinder)
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(BiocParallel)

```

  #.an out of bounds error message. The workaround is to split the data based on batches, run the clustering per batch and 
  # concatenate them back together.
